title: Another Blog Post
description: This frontmatter description will appear below the title
---

This is an example post, with a [link](https://nextjs.org) using markdown syntax and a React component:

<Box>
  This is a Box Component
  <Link href="https://nextjs.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer">This is a Link Component</Link>
</Box>

The title and description are pulled from the MDX file and processed using `gray-matter`. Additionally, links are rendered using a custom component passed to `next-mdx-remote`.
